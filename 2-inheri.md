Absolutely! Here's a comprehensive list of **interview questions on inheritance in Python**, including **scenario-based examples** and follow-ups. These are common in both beginner and intermediate-level interviews and will help you understand and explain inheritance clearly.

## ðŸ§  Core Inheritance Questions (with Scenarios)

---

### **1. What is inheritance in Python?**

ðŸ§ª *Scenario:*
You're building a ride-sharing app. You have a class `Vehicle` and want `Car`, `Bike`, and `AutoRickshaw` to share common behavior like `start_engine()` and `stop_engine()`.

âœ… **Expected Answer:**
Inheritance allows a class (`Child`) to use properties and methods of another class (`Parent`). It helps with code reuse and logical hierarchy.

---

### **2. Explain single inheritance with an example.**

ðŸ§ª *Scenario:*
Create a class `Employee` with a method `work()`, and another class `Developer` that inherits from `Employee`.

```python
class Employee:
    def work(self):
        print("Working...")

class Developer(Employee):
    pass

d = Developer()
d.work()  # Inherited method
```

---

### **3. What is multilevel inheritance?**

ðŸ§ª *Scenario:*
You are modeling an electric vehicle system:

```text
Vehicle â†’ Car â†’ ElectricCar
```

```python
class Vehicle:
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Engine started")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def drive(self):
        print("Driving...")

class ElectricCar(Car):
    def charge(self):
        print("Charging battery...")

e = ElectricCar()
e.start_engine()
e.drive()
e.charge()
```

âœ… **Interview Tip:** Explain how each level adds behavior and how `ElectricCar` inherits all behaviors from both `Car` and `Vehicle`.

---

### **4. What is multiple inheritance? What issues can it cause?**

ðŸ§ª *Scenario:*
You have a class `GPS` and a class `EntertainmentSystem`. You want `SmartCar` to inherit both.

```python
class GPS:
    def location(self):
        print("GPS tracking...")

class EntertainmentSystem:
    def play_music(self):
        print("Playing music...")

class SmartCar(GPS, EntertainmentSystem):
    pass
```

âœ… **Explain:**

* Multiple inheritance lets a class inherit from more than one base class.
* Can lead to the **Diamond Problem**, where method resolution becomes ambiguous.

---

### **5. What is the MRO (Method Resolution Order)?**

ðŸ§ª *Scenario:*
In multiple inheritance, which method gets called first?

```python
class A:
    def test(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def test(self):
        print("B")

class C(A):
    def test(self):
        print("C")

class D(B, C):
    pass

d = D()
d.test()  # Output?
```

âœ… **Answer:**
Python uses C3 linearization (MRO) â€” it checks classes left to right. So the output will be `"B"`.

Use:

```python
print(D.mro())
```

---

### **6. How can you override a method in a subclass?**

ðŸ§ª *Scenario:*
You want to customize the `drive()` method for `ElectricCar`.

```python
class Car:
    def drive(self):
        print("Driving on fuel")

class ElectricCar(Car):
    def drive(self):
        print("Driving on electricity")

e = ElectricCar()
e.drive()  # Overrides the parent method
```

---

### **7. What is the role of `super()` in inheritance?**

ðŸ§ª *Scenario:*
You want to call the parent class constructor from the child.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, grade):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.grade = grade
```

âœ… **Answer:**
`super()` is used to call a method from the parent classâ€”especially useful in constructors or when overriding methods.

---

### **8. How is constructor behavior handled in multilevel inheritance?**

ðŸ§ª *Scenario:*
When creating an `ElectricCar`, how do you ensure the `Vehicle` class also gets initialized?

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self):
        print("Vehicle initialized")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        print("Car initialized")

class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        print("ElectricCar initialized")

ec = ElectricCar()
```

âœ… Output:

```
Vehicle initialized
Car initialized
ElectricCar initialized
```

---

### **9. Can a child class inherit private members of the parent?**

ðŸ§ª *Scenario:*
Suppose the parent class has a method `__secret()`.

âœ… **Answer:**
No, private members (`__method`) are **name-mangled** and not directly accessible in the child class.

---

### **10. What is composition vs inheritance? When to use one over the other?**

ðŸ§ª *Scenario:*
You're building a `SmartPhone`. Should it inherit from `Camera`, `Speaker`, and `GPS`, or contain them?

âœ… **Answer:**

* Use **inheritance** when there's an **"is-a"** relationship.
* Use **composition** when there's a **"has-a"** relationship.

```python
class Camera:
    def take_photo(self):
        print("Photo taken")

class SmartPhone:
    def __init__(self):
        self.camera = Camera()

    def click(self):
        self.camera.take_photo()
```

## ðŸ§© Advanced / Bonus Questions

* How does Python resolve method conflicts in multiple inheritance?
* What is the diamond problem and how does Python solve it?
* Can you dynamically add methods to a subclass?
* What happens if you don't call `super().__init__()` in a child class?
* How would you implement an interface-like structure in Python (since Python doesn't have formal interfaces)?
