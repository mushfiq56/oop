### 📘 **Interfaces in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

An **interface** in OOP is a contract that defines a set of **abstract methods** which a class must implement. It specifies **what** the class should do but not **how** it should do it. Interfaces are primarily used to ensure that certain classes follow a specific behavior, regardless of the underlying implementation.

### **Key Characteristics of Interfaces:**

1. **Abstract Methods Only**: An interface typically contains only abstract methods, meaning methods that are declared without any implementation. Classes that implement an interface must provide an implementation for all methods of the interface.

2. **No Implementation**: Interfaces do not contain any concrete (non-abstract) methods. They only define the signatures of methods.

3. **Multiple Implementations**: A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for more flexible and reusable code.

4. **Polymorphism**: Interfaces enable polymorphism, as different classes can implement the same interface and provide different implementations for the methods defined in the interface.

5. **No Constructors or State**: Interfaces do not define instance variables or constructors. They focus solely on behavior.

### **How do you implement an Interface in Java?**

In Java, interfaces are declared using the `interface` keyword, and methods within them are automatically abstract unless specified otherwise.

**Java Syntax:**

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();  // Abstract method
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();   // Instantiate a Dog object
        a.sound();              // Output: Bark!
    }
}
```

### **Interface vs. Abstract Class in Java:**

| **Abstract Class**                           | **Interface**                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can have both abstract and concrete methods  | Can only have abstract methods (Java 8 allows default methods) |
| Can have instance variables and constructors | Cannot have instance variables or constructors                 |
| A class can inherit only one abstract class  | A class can implement multiple interfaces                      |
| Used when classes share common functionality | Used to define a contract for unrelated classes                |

### **How do you implement an Interface in Python?**

Python does not have interfaces like Java or C#. However, it achieves similar functionality using **Abstract Base Classes (ABC)**. Python allows you to create abstract methods in a class and force subclasses to implement those methods, mimicking the behavior of an interface.

**Python Syntax:**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Bark!")

d = Dog()
d.sound()  # Output: Bark!
```

### **Interface vs Abstract Base Class in Python:**

In Python:

* **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)** can provide default behavior and methods (i.e., concrete methods), similar to abstract classes in Java.
* **Interfaces (simulated via ABCs)** typically only define abstract methods and don't provide any implementation. However, Python doesn’t have an official "interface" keyword, and abstract classes can serve this role.

---

### **Why Use Interfaces?**

1. **Decoupling Code**: Interfaces allow you to decouple the code that uses the interface from the code that implements the interface. This enables flexibility in changing the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

2. **Defining Contracts**: Interfaces define a contract that classes must follow. This is useful in scenarios where you want to ensure multiple classes follow the same structure but may have different internal implementations.

3. **Multiple Inheritance**: Unlike classes, which can only extend one superclass in languages like Java, a class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit behaviors from multiple sources.

4. **Polymorphism**: Interfaces promote polymorphism, enabling the same method to behave differently based on the object type, as all objects implementing an interface share a common method signature.

---

### **When to Use an Interface?**

* When you want to enforce a certain behavior across different classes without specifying how they should perform that behavior.
* When you need multiple classes to implement similar functionality, but the classes may not share a common parent class.
* When designing systems that need to support multiple implementations of the same method signature.

---

### **Interface Example in Java with Multiple Implementations:**

```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();  // Abstract method
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Rectangle");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape shape1 = new Circle();
        Shape shape2 = new Rectangle();
        
        shape1.draw();  // Output: Drawing Circle
        shape2.draw();  // Output: Drawing Rectangle
    }
}
```

### **Interface Example in Python with Multiple Implementations:**

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def draw(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing Circle")

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing Rectangle")

circle = Circle()
rectangle = Rectangle()

circle.draw()   # Output: Drawing Circle
rectangle.draw()  # Output: Drawing Rectangle
```

---

### **Benefits of Interfaces**

1. **Flexible Design**: Interfaces promote a flexible design where components can be easily replaced or extended.
2. **Code Reusability**: By implementing multiple interfaces, a class can inherit different behaviors from multiple sources.
3. **Loose Coupling**: Interfaces help in reducing dependency between objects, making the codebase easier to maintain and modify.
4. **Improved Testing**: Interfaces make it easier to write unit tests, as mock implementations of the interfaces can be used to test different scenarios.

---

### **Can an Interface Have Default Methods?**

In **Java 8 and later**, interfaces can have **default methods**, which provide a default implementation. This feature allows you to add new methods to an interface without breaking the existing implementing classes.

**Java Example with Default Methods:**

```java
interface Animal {
    default void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }

    void sound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();   // Output: Bark!
        dog.sleep();   // Output: Sleeping...
    }
}
```

In **Python**, you can simulate default methods by providing default implementations in abstract base classes.

---

### **Can Interfaces Have Static Methods?**

Yes, in **Java 8 and later**, interfaces can have **static methods**. These static methods are not inherited by the implementing classes, but they can be called directly on the interface.

**Java Example with Static Methods:**

```java
interface Shape {
    static void info() {
        System.out.println("Shape Interface");
    }

    void draw();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape.info();  // Output: Shape Interface
    }
}
```

---

### **Conclusion:**

* **Interfaces** provide a way to define behavior contracts that must be implemented by classes.
* In languages like Java, interfaces are key to defining **polymorphic behavior** and ensuring **decoupling** between different parts of a system.
* In Python, interfaces are simulated using **Abstract Base Classes (ABC)**, providing similar functionality but with more flexibility.
Here's an extended and **interview-ready** deep dive into **Interfaces**, with **clear concepts**, **Java & Python examples**, and **Q\&A format** for your notes.

# 📘 Interface in OOP

**🧩 Interface** defines a **contract** for what a class can do, **without specifying how** it does it.

It’s like saying:

> “Any class that signs this contract must provide behavior for these listed methods.”

---

## ✅ Key Points:

* **All methods** in an interface are **abstract** (implicitly in Java, explicitly in Python).
* Interfaces support **multiple inheritance**.
* Used to achieve **100% abstraction** in Java.
* **Python** doesn't have interfaces but uses **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)** to simulate similar behavior.

---

### 🟨 Java Syntax:

```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();  // Implicitly public & abstract
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}
```

---

### 🟦 Python Equivalent (ABC style):

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def draw(self):
        pass

class Circle(Shape):
    def draw(self):
        print("Drawing Circle")
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Interview Questions About Interfaces

---

### **1. Can interfaces have method implementations?**

**Java: ✅ Since Java 8**, interfaces can have:

* **Default methods** (with body)
* **Static methods** (with body)

```java
interface Shape {
    void draw();
    
    default void log() {
        System.out.println("Logging shape");
    }

    static void info() {
        System.out.println("Static method in interface");
    }
}
```

**Python: ✅ Yes.** Abstract base classes can have concrete methods.

---

### **2. Can a class implement multiple interfaces?**

**✅ Yes.** This is one of the **main advantages** of interfaces — they support **multiple inheritance**.

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

interface Swimmable {
    void swim();
}

class Duck implements Flyable, Swimmable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Flying");
    }
    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("Swimming");
    }
}
```

In Python, it's also possible with ABCs:

```python
class Flyable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def fly(self):
        pass

class Swimmable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def swim(self):
        pass

class Duck(Flyable, Swimmable):
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying")
    def swim(self):
        print("Swimming")
```

---

### **3. Can an interface extend another interface?**

✅ **Yes.** An interface can extend one or more interfaces (Java allows multiple).

```java
interface Animal {
    void eat();
}

interface Mammal extends Animal {
    void walk();
}
```

---

### **4. Can a class extend an abstract class and implement an interface at the same time?**

✅ **Yes.** A class can **extend one abstract class** and **implement multiple interfaces**.

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void eat();
}

interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Bird extends Animal implements Flyable {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }

    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Flying...");
    }
}
```

---

### **5. What's the difference between Interface and Abstract Class?**

| Feature     | Interface                      | Abstract Class                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Inheritance | Multiple inheritance allowed   | Single inheritance only       |
| Methods     | Only abstract (until Java 8)   | Abstract + Concrete           |
| Constructor | ❌ No constructors              | ✅ Can have constructors       |
| Variables   | Only public static final       | Can have all types            |
| Use Case    | Define capability (what to do) | Define partial implementation |

---

### **6. Can an interface contain variables?**

✅ Yes, but:

* All variables in a Java interface are **implicitly `public static final`** (i.e., constants).
* They must be initialized.

```java
interface Config {
    int TIMEOUT = 5000; // public static final
}
```

---

### **7. Can we create an object of an interface?**

❌ **No.** You cannot instantiate an interface directly.
✅ You can use **interface references** to refer to an object of a class that implements it (polymorphism).

```java
Shape s = new Circle();  // ✅ Interface reference
```

---

### **8. Why use interfaces if abstract classes exist?**

Interfaces are better when:

* You need **multiple inheritance**.
* You want to define a **pure behavior contract**.
* You need **shared behavior without shared state**.

Abstract classes are better when:

* You want to **share implementation**.
* You need to manage **state/data** across subclasses.

---

### **9. Can interfaces be nested?**

✅ Yes, Java allows you to define **interfaces within classes or other interfaces** (nested interfaces).

---

### **10. What happens if a class doesn't implement all methods of an interface?**

❌ It must be declared **abstract**, or the compiler throws an error (in Java).

---

### **11. Can interfaces be generic?**

✅ Yes.

```java
interface Box<T> {
    void put(T item);
}
```

---

### **12. Can we override `Object` class methods (like `toString`) in an interface?**

✅ Since Java 8, you can provide **default implementations** of methods like `toString()`, but it’s not common.

---

### **13. Can interfaces inherit from abstract classes?**

❌ No. Interfaces can **only extend other interfaces**. They cannot extend classes (abstract or not).

---

## 🧪 Summary Code Example

### Java:

```java
interface Device {
    void start();
    void stop();

    default void log() {
        System.out.println("Device log");
    }
}

class Computer implements Device {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Booting up");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Shutting down");
    }
}
```

### Python:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Device(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def start(self): pass

    @abstractmethod
    def stop(self): pass

    def log(self):
        print("Device log")

class Computer(Device):
    def start(self):
        print("Booting up")
    def stop(self):
        print("Shutting down")
```
